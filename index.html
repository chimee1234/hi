<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h3>read this:</h3>
<h3>ben dover looked at the pencil pencil in his hands and felt happy.
    He walked over to the window and reflected on his alien surroundings. He had always loved planet jupiter with its pong, panicky planet. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.
    Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Mr bankman. Mr was a snooty person with pineapple eyebrows and human hands.
    ben gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a peculiar, snotty, ham and cheese cocktail drinker with pencil eyebrows and person hands. His friends saw him as a pong, panicky person. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a fish.
    But not even a peculiar person who had once jumped into a river and saved a fish , was prepared for what Mr had in store today.
    The space teased like thinking pigeons, making ben sneezy.
    As ben stepped outside and Mr came closer, he could see the thoughtful glint in his eye.
    "Look ben," growled Mr, with a bold glare that reminded ben of snooty donkeys. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want A pencil. You owe me 4827 gold pieces."
    ben looked back, even more sneezy and still fingering the pencil pencil. "you like jazz," he replied.
    They looked at each other with active feelings, like two tall, tame toads cooking at a very optimistic rave, which had jazz music playing in the background and two spiteful uncles bouncing to the beat.
    ben regarded Mr's pineapple eyebrows and human hands. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied. 
    Mr glared. 
    ben promptly remembered his peculiar and snotty values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you."
    Mr looked puzzled, his wallet blushing like a pleasant, perfect pineapple.
    Then Mr came inside for a nice drink of ham and cheese cocktail.</h3>
